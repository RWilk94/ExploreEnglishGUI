Określeń somebody /someone - ktoś, something - coś oraz somewhere - gdzieś, dokądś używamy w zdaniach twierdzących.
Np. There is somebody at the door.
- Ktoś jest za drzwiami.
I want to go somewhere tonight.
- Chcę gdzieś pójść dziś wieczorem.

Określeń anybody/anyone - ktoś, nikt, anything - coś, nic, oraz anywhere - dokądś, donikąd, gdzieś, nigdzie, używamy w pytaniach i przeczeniach.
Ich znaczenie w zdaniach pytających jest inne niż w przeczeniach:

zdania pytające / zdania przeczące
anybody/anyone - ktoś - nikt
anything - coś -  nic
anywhere - dokądś, gdzieś - nigdzie, donikąd
Np. Is there anything on the table?
There isn't anything on the table.

W zdaniach przeczących zamiast not anybody/not anything/not anywhere można używać określeń nobody /no one, nothing
i nowhere.
Uwaga: Zauważ, że w języku angielskim w zdaniach przeczących może występować tylko jedno słowo przeczące, inaczej niż w języku polskim.

There isn't anything on the table = There is nothing on the table.
- Na stole nie ma nic.
