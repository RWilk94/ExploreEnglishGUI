ours

Uwaga: Od zaimka osobowego it nie tworzy się zaimka dzierżawczego.


Określniki dzierżawcze informują:
a) że coś należy do kogoś,
b) o relacjach między ludźmi, np. o pokrewieństwie.
Określników dzierżawczych używamy przed rzeczownikami, a zaimków dzierżawczych zamiast rzeczowników
Np. This is my bag. This bag is mine.
That is their car. That car is theirs.
