Czas Present Perfect tworzymy za pomocą czasownika posiłkowego have/has oraz imiesłowu biernego czasownika głównego.
W przypadku czasowników regularnych imiesłów ten tworzy się przez dodanie końcówki -ed do formy podstawowej czasownika,
np. clean - cleaned, study - studied.

Czasowniki nieregularne tworzą formę imiesłowu biernego na różne sposoby, np. give - given, buy- bought, put- put
(lista tych czasowników znajduje się na końcu książki).

W zdaniach pytających przesuwamy have/has przed podmiot (rzeczownik lub zaimek), np. Has she cleaned the room?
- Czy ona posprzątała pokój? Have you written a letter? - Czy napisałeś list.

W zdaniach przeczących do have/has dodajemy partykutę not, np. She has not/hasn't cleaned the room.
- Ona nie posprzątała pokoju. I have not/haven't written a letter. - Nie napisałem listu.
