boss in an hour. - On za godzinę

Konstrukcję tę tworzymy przy użyciu odpowiedniej formy czasownika
to be (is, am, are), going to oraz formy podstawowej czasownika.
Np. He is going to eat out tonight. - On dziś zamierza zjeść kolację w restauracji.
W zdaniach pytających przesuwamy formę czasownika to be przed podmiot
Np. Is he going to eat out tonight? - Czy on zamierza dziś zjeść kolację w restauracji?
W zdaniach przeczących po formie czasownika to be stawiamy partykułę not.
Np. He is not/isn't going to eat out tonight. - On nie zamierza dziś jeść kolacji w restauracji.

Konstrukcji be going to używamy:
a) do opisywania planów i zamiarów dotyczących (bliskiej) przyszłości.

- On zamierza kupić sobie w lecie rower.
b) kiedy na podstawie widocznych oznak wnioskujemy, że coś się wydarzy w bliskiej przyszłości.

I am not going to leave

Aby powiedzieć, że zdecydowaliśmy, iż coś zrobimy w przyszłości, a nawet podjęliśmy pewne kroki zmierzające do realizacji tego planu, używamy czasu Present Continuous.
Np. I am meeting Helen at two o'clock. - Spotkam się z Helen o drugiej.
Czasu tego używamy także z czasownikami ruchu np.
come - przyjść,
 go - isć,
fly - lecieć,
travel - podróżować,
 leave - wyjść, wyjechać itp.
Np. I am leaving for Paris tomorrow. - Wyjeżdżam jutro do Paryża. (Jest to już postanowione, np. kupiłem już bilet, zarezerwowałem miejscówkę itp.)
