Istnieją dwa rodzaje pytań:

pytania o rozstrzygnięcie, czyli takie, na które odpowiadamy Yes/No.

Na pierwszym miejscu stoi w nich czasownik posiłkowy (np. is, are, have, has, will, can, do, does, did itp.), a po nim podmiot.
Na pytania te odpowiadamy zwykle Yes/ No.

Np. Are you watching TV?- Czy oglądasz telewizję?
Yes, I am. - Tak, oglądam.
Have you finished yet?- Skończyłaś już?
No, I haven't. - Nie.
Can you type?- Czy potrafisz pisać na maszynie?
No, I can't. - Nie, nie potrafię.

W zdaniach w czasie Present Simple (z orzeczeniem w formie play, works itp.) do tworzenia pytań używamy czasownika posiłkowego do/does.
Np. Do you play golf every Saturday?- Czy grasz w golfa w każdą sobotę? Yes, I do. - Tak, gram.
Does he work hard?- Czy on ciężko pracuje?
No, he doesn't. - Nie.

W zdaniach w czasie Past Simple (z orzeczeniem w formie arrived, sent itp.) do tworzenia pytań używamy czasownika
posiłkowego did.
Np. Did she arrive early last night?- Czy ona przyjechała wcześnie wczoraj w nocy? Yes, she did. - Tak.
Did they send you a letter?- Czy oni przysłali ci list? No, they didn't. - Nie.
