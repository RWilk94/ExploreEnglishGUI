Grandpa, did you have a TV when you were five?
No, I didn't. People didn't have TVs then. They had radios.

W czasie Past Simple czasownik have (got) ma we wszystkich osobach i liczbach formę had.
W zdaniach pytających używamy czasownika posiłkowego did, zaimka (lub rzeczownika) w funkcji podmiotu oraz czasownika have.
Np. Did you have many toys when you were a child?- Czy miałeś/miałaś dużo zabawek, kiedy byłeś/byłaś dzieckiem?
W zdaniach przeczących przed have stawiamy did not:
Np. / did not/didn't have many toys when I was a child - Nie mianem/miałam dużo zabawek, kiedy byłem/byłam dzieckiem.
