Julie and her daughter didn't stay at home last weekend
They went to a friend's house in the mountains.
They played in the snow and had a Jot of fun.

Czas Past Simple czasowników regularnych tworzymy, dodając końcówkę -ed do formy podstawowej czasownika.
Np. He played football yesterday - On grał wczoraj w piłkę.
Pytania tworzymy za pomocą czasownika posiłkowego did, po którym stawiamy zaimek osobowy lub rzeczownik, a następnie czasownik główny w formie podstawowej, a więc bez końcówki -ed.
Np. Did he play football yesterday?- Czy on grał wczoraj w piłkę?
Formy przeczące tworzymy przez użycie did not/didn't z czasownikiem głównym formie podstawowej, a więc również bez -ed.
Np. He did not/didn't play football yesterday - On nie grał wczoraj w piłkę.

I worked.
You worked.
He worked.
She worked.
It worked.
We worked.
You worked.
They worked.
I did not work.
You did not work.
He did not work.
She did not work.
It did not work.
We did not work.
You did not work.
They did not work.

I didn't work.
You didn't work.
He didn't work.
She didn't work.
It didn't work.
We didn't work.
You didn't work.
They didn't work.
Did I work?
Did you work?
Did he work?
Did she work?
Did it work?
Did we work?
Did you work?
Did they work?

Do czasowników kończących się na -e dodajemy samo -d, np. like - liked
W czasownikach kończących się spółgłoską + y, opuszczamy -y i dodajemy -ied,
np. study- studied
W czasownikach kończących się samogłoską + y dodajemy tylko końcówkę -ed,
np. play - played, stay - stayed

W czasownikach, w których ostatnia sylaba jest akcentowana, a po akcentowanej samogłosce występuje spółgłoską, spółgłoskę tę podwajamy i dodajemy końcówkę -ed.
np. stop - stopped ale visit - visited
W czasownikach zakończonych na -I podwajamy I,
np. travel - travelled, quarrel - quarrelled

Końcówkę -ed wymawiamy jako:
a) /d/, jeśli czasownik w formie podstawowej kończy się głoską
/t/ lub / d/.
wanted, mended
b) /t/, jeśli czasownik w formie podstawowej kończy się głoską
/k/, /s/, /tJ/, /J/, /f/ lub /p/.
liked, missed, watched, washed, laughed, stopped
c) /d/, jeśli czasownik w formie podstawowej kończy się inną głoską
closed, studied, loved, robbed

Od czasowników nieregularnych nie tworzy się czasu Past Simple przez dodanie końcówki -ed, np. go - went, see - saw, drink - drank
(patrz: lista czasowników nieregularnych na końcu książki). Pytania i przeczenia tworzymy za pomocą czasownika positkowego
did/did not, po którym występuje czasownik główny w formie podstawowej, np. He went out. - (On) wyszedł Did he go out? - Czy (on)
wyszedł? He didn't go out. - (On) nie wyszedł.

I went.
You went.
He went.
She went.
It went.
We went.
You went.
They went.

I did not go.
You did not go
He did not go.
She did not go.
It did not go.
We did not go.
You did not go.
They did not go.

I didn't go
You didn't go.
He didn't go.
She didn't go.
It didn't go.
We didn't go
You didn't go
They didn't go.

Did I go?
Did you go?
Did he go?
Did she go?
Did it go?
Did we go?
Did you go?
Did they go?

Czasu Past Simple używamy do opisywania:
czynności, które wydarzyły się w określonym momencie w przeszłości, tzn. wiadomo, kiedy miały miejsce.

They got married 15 years ago.
- Pobrali się 75 lat temu.
(When did they get married? 75 years ago
- Kiedy się pobrali? 75 lat temu)

czynności, które odbywały się w przeszłości z pewną regularnością,
ale już się nie odbywają. W tym wypadku w zdaniu mogą się pojawić
przysłówki częstotliwości (np. always - zawsze, often - czrsto,
usually - zazwyczaj itp.)

My father often took me to the playground
when I was a small girl
- Ojciec często zabierał mnie na plac zabaw,
kiedy byłam mała.

czynności, które w przeszłości następowały jedna po drugiej.
First, they had lunch. Najpierw zjedli obiad.
Then, they met some friends. Potem spotkali się ze znajomymi.

Oprócz określeń czasu wymienionych na str. 61, typowe dla czasu Past Simple są m.in.: last Monday/Tuesday etc - w ubiegly
poniedziałek/wtorek itp.,
then - wtedy
Zwróć uwagę, że nazwy dni tygodnia - podobnie jak miesięcy - piszemy w języku angielskim dużą literą.
Dla czasu Past Simple charakterystyczny jest też spójnik when - kiedy,
wprowadzający zdanie czasowe.

Uwaga: Przed wyrazem last i next nie używamy przyimków, chociaż
występują one w niektórych wyrażeniach w języku polskim:
last night - wczoraj wieczorem/w nocy,
last Sunday - w ubiegłą niedzielę,
last weekend- w ostatni weekend,
next month- w przyszłym miesiącu itd.
(patrz również: informacje na str 78).
