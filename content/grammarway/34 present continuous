Czas Present Continuous składa się z odpowiedniej formy czasownika posiłkowego to be oraz czasownika z koncówką -ing.

I am working.
You are working.
He is working.
She is working.
It is working.
We are working.
You are working.
They are working.

I'm working.
You're working.
He's working.
She's working.
It's working.
We're working.
You're working.
They're working.

I am not working.
You are not working.
He is not working.
She is not working.
It is not working.
We are not working.

They are not working.

I'm not working.
You aren't working.
He isn't working.
She isn't working.

Am I working?
Are you working?
Is he working?

W przypadku czasowników, które kończą się na -e, najczęściej opuszczamy -e i dodajemy końcówkę -ing.
write -> writing, ale see - seeing

Jeśli -ing dodajemy do czasownika zakończonego sylabą zawierającą
pojedynczą akcentowaną samogłoską, po której następuje spółgłoska, spółgłoskę podwajamy.
sit -> sitting, swim -> swimming, ale open -> opening

W czasownikach kończących się na -I podwajamy tę literę:
travel -> travelling

W czasownikach kończących się na -ie zastępujemy -ie końcówką -y + ing.
lie - lying, die - dying


Czasu Present Continuous używamy do opisywania
a) czynności, które odbywają się w momencie, gdy o nich mówimy.
They are walking in the park now.
- Oni teraz spacerują po parku.

b) czynności tymczasowych, które odbywają się obecnie, ale niekoniecznie w momencie mówienia.

She is working hard these days. - Ona obecnie ciężko pracuje.
Right now she is not working. She is yawning.
- W tym momencie nie pracuje. Teraz ziewa.

Dla czasu Present Continuous charakterystyczne są następujące określenia czasu:
now - teraz, właśnie
at the moment - w tej chwili
at present - obecnie
these days - w ostatnich dniach itp.
