Question tags to krótkie pytania dodawane na końcu zdania.
Używa się ich głównie w mowie potocznej, by otrzymać potwierdzenie lub by dowiedzieć się, czy coś jest prawdą, czy nie.

They're very small, aren't they?
Rabbits don't eat meat, do they?
A tiger has got stripes, hasn't it?

Question tags składają się z czasownika posiłkowego oraz odpowiedniego zaimka osobowego.
Np. Rita can speak French, can't she?
You have spent a lot of money, haven't you?

Jeśli czasownik w zdaniu ma formę Present Simple, w question tag używamy do lub does oraz zaimka osobowego. Jeśli czasownik ma
formę Past Simple, używamy czasownika posiłkowego did i zaimka osobowego.
Np. He likes golf doesn't he?
Kevin went to Rome last year, didn't he?

Jeśli zdanie główne jest twierdzące, question tag ma formę przeczącą.
Np. She was at home, wasn't she?
He lives in a flat, doesn't he?

Jeśli zdanie główne jest Przeczyce, question tag ma formę twierdzącą.
Np. They haven't finished yet, have they?
She won't come to the party, will she?

Jeśli zdanie zawiera słowo o znaczeniu przeczenia, takie jak never,
hardly, seldom, czy rarely question tag ma formę twierdzącą.
Np. He is never late, is he?
They seldom go to the theatre, do they?

rozmówcy potwierdzenia, question tags wymawiamy z intonacją
opadającą.
