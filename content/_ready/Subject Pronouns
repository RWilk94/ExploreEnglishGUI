<b>Zaimki osobowe w funkcji podmiotu</b>

Zaimki osobowe w funkcji podmiotu zastępują rzeczownik (podmiot) i pozwalają uniknąć jego powtórzeń.
Takie zaimki odpowiadają na pytania – kto? co? W języku angielskim jest to szczególnie przydatne,
ponieważ podmiot występuje zawsze i nie możemy go opuścić. (inaczej niż w języku polskim)

Jakie są zaimki w języku angielskim? Spójrz poniżej:
I - ja
You – ty, wy
He - on
She - ona
It – ono, to
We - my
You – ty, wy
They - oni

Zaimek I zawsze piszemy wielką literą!
Zaimek you oznacza zarówno ty (l.poj), wy (l.mn) ale także pan, pani, państwo. Znaczenie zależy od kontekstu.
Zaimków he oraz she używa się mówiąc o ludziach. Mówiąc o rzeczach, roślinach lub zwierzętach stosuje się zaimek it.
The dog is big. It is also hairy. (It = the dog) - Pies jest duży. Jest też owłosiony. (To = pies)
My bed is small but it is comfortable. (It = my bed) - Moje łóżko jest małe, ale wygodne. (To = moje łóżko)

Czasami, gdy nie znamy płci dziecka (nie wiemy, czy jest to chłopiec czy dziewczynka), możemy skorzystać z it.
Their baby is very small. It only weighs 2 kilos. (It = the baby.) - Ich dziecko jest bardzo małe. Waży tylko 2 kilogramy. (To = dziecko.)

It używamy, gdy mówimy o czasie, pogodzie lub temperaturze.
It is five o'clock (= the time is five o'clock) – Jest piąta (godzina).
It is cold today. (= the weather is cold today.) – Jest zimno (dzisiaj).
It is 30º outside right now. (= the temperature is 30º outside right now) - W tej chwili jest 30º na zewnątrz. (= temperatura na zewnątrz wynosi teraz 30º)
