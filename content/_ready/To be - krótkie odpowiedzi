To be - krótkie odpowiedzi

W mówionym języku angielskim, na pytania odpowiadamy używając krótkich odpowiedzi:

Czy jesteś studentem? - Tak jestem studentem.
Ostatnia część (student) nie jest konieczna. Używamy krótkich odpowiedzi, aby uniknąć powtórzeń, gdy znaczenie jest jasne.

Am I intelligent?	Yes, you are.	No, you aren't.
Are you a student?	Yes, I am.	No, I am not.
Is he a pilot?	Yes, he is.	No, he isn't.
Is she from Spain?	Yes, she is.	No, she isn't.
Is it a big house?	Yes, it is.	No, it isn't.
Are we ready?	Yes, we are.	No, we aren't.
Are you doctors?	Yes, we are.	No, we aren't.
Are they rich?	Yes, they are.	No, they aren't.

W krótkich odpowiedziach nie używamy formy skróconej.
Natomiast w odpowiedziach negatywnych, dozwolone jest skracanie według poniższej zasady:
is not = isn't
are not = aren't
